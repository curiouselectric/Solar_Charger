# Solar_Charger
A DIY Solar Charger for 18650 Lithium Ion cells.

Get off-grid, power your remote project and learn about solar power with this DIY solar charger kit.

This is a relatively simple open-source kit, sold at www.curiouselectric.co.uk and on Tindie: https://www.tindie.com/products/reinnovation/solar-matic/, which includes two 1Wp solar PV panels and all the parts required to recharge standard 18650 lithium ion cells.

The charger IC is the [BQ24210 from Texas Instruments](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/bq24210.pdf). This is an amazing single-cell Lithium Ion battery charge IC with up to 800mA current rating. It is designed to maximise the output from a solar PV cell into the battery. This is a very small surface mount component in a WSON-10 package, so we have soldered this to the PCB for you.

The kit is uses a DC-DC converter which ensures a regulated 5V output, either for a USB connector output or for screw terminals. The DC-DC converter is controlled via a switch on the side of the PCB.

The unit comes with a simple laser-cut enclosure so it can be placed on a window-sill or hung somewhere.

This is a reasonably simple kit which requires some soldering and a few fiddly connections.

*Note: Depending upon the capacity of the 18650 cell, in the UK the battery will fully recharge in around 3-5 days during an average summers day. This totally depends upon the solar resource available.*

*Note: The enclosure is NOT waterproof or for outdoor use.*
